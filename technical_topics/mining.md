# Mining

### Introduction to Mining

Miners on a blockchain network serve the purpose of validating transactions for a given block. For their efforts, miners are awarded in newly minted currency. This means that no entity is paying the miner. The miner is given the luxury of creating new money for himself which will be accepted by the rest of the network. In order to be selected to be the miner for a given block, one must be the first to complete a cryptographic challenge and broadcast the result to the network. The miner for a given block verifies the transactions and broadcasts the finalized block to be accepted by the network. The process starts again with miners attempting to mine the next block.

### Mining Pools

In order to compete with larger players, individuals with less powerful machines can join a mining pool which will aggregate the hash power of all of its members and act as one miner. If this pool wins an award, the payment is split among the members according to the amount of hash power they contributed with the operator of the pool taking a percentage as well.
