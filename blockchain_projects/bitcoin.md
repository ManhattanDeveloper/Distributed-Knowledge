## Description
Bitcoin, first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in a white paper in 2008, is a cryptocurrency utilized in payment systems. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are facilitated using blockchain, with all transactions being viewable but pseudonymous. This means that every public key’s transactions can be tracked, but a public key isn’t explicitly connected to its owner’s real identity. Bitcoin relies upon the transfer of value on the ledger between different wallets on the network. When a transaction is sent from a wallet to another, one wallet utilizes a private key to digitally sign and verify that the transaction is legitimate. These transactions are bundled together into groups known as blocks. This block is then sent to every node on the network, with the nodes examining and approving the block in a process known as mining. Then, the block is added to the chain, thus verifying those set of transactions.

The mining system is utilized to introduce digital scarcity, as well as incentivize nodes to participate in the system. The first miner to get the correct hash is awarded 12.5 bitcoins; this amount is halved every 210,000 blocks processed. At the same time, the difficulty is adjusted to maintain approximately a 10 minute block process time. Miners are also paid fees by users utilizing the transaction services of the miner. The total amount of Bitcoins is capped at 21M Bitcoins; beyond this point, mining will not yield Bitcoins.
