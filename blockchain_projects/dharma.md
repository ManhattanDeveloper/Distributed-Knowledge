## Description

	Dharma is a project by Nadav Hollander announced in May 2017 aimed at building an open source protocol to facilitate a decentralized lending system, enabling cryptocurrency loans in a p2p lending system. Dharma aims to facilitate lending markets on the Ethereum blockchain by providing smart programmable tools that will enable relayers and underwriters to facilitate cryptocurrency lending.  Use of the Dharma protocol provides a standardized information ledger that enables underwriters to examine a debtor’s full credit history, enabling any number of underwriting services to participate in a free market. This is because the use of blockchain enables creditors and debtors to fully view the counterparty’s history, providing further insight into creditworthiness. 
	The protocol’s use of smart contracts built upon the Ethereum network enables the creation of debt contracts with specific repayment terms. This system enables end-to-end processing of debt instruments, enabling the issuing, underwriting, and administration of debt. Debtors can request loans via relayers or other networks, with creditors filling the debt order by signing a debt kernel on the Ethereum network. In between the debtors and creditors, underwriters provide credit services and relayers process the debt orders.
