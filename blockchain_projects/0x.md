## Description
0x is an open protocol meant to facilitate “low friction peer-to-peer exchange of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain”; serving as an open protocol enables 0x to offer interoperability between different dApps. Trades conducted on the 0x protocol are run through Ethereum smart contracts that any dApp can utilize without payment. On the 0x protocol, anyone can build a relayer (decentralized exchange) that has shared liquidity with other relayers on the network. 

The 0x protocol utilizes a combination of off-chain and on-chain processes to reduce reliance on the network for trading operations and thereby reduce friction costs for market makers. In this system, relayers are used to broadcast orders, submitting orders to the network transport layer. These orders are then sent to the order book for any taker to fill; once the taker fills the order, the transaction is then sent to the Ethereum blockchain.

0x features a native token, $ZRX. ZRX is used as a governance token for decentralized governance, and can also be used by relayers to charge fees. Stakeholders of ZRX are able to vote on decisions impacting the 0x protocol.
