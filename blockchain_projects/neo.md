## Description
Neo is a blockchain platform as well as a cryptocurrency that acts as a “distributed network for the Smart Economy.” Neo has been compared to Ethereum, in that both offer generalized blockchains for developers to build upon, especially the use of smart contract systems. However, it is important to note that Neo is centered around the creation of a smart economy. Malcolm Lerider explains that “NEO Smart Economy is the next generation of economy and trade where trade agreements are written in programming code using a Smart Contract. The Smart Contract is stored in a decentralized immutable blockchain and will be executed exactly according to the trading agreement, and exactly at the time agreed upon.” [Source](https://medium.com/@MalcolmLerider/what-is-neo-smart-economy-381a4c6ee286)

NEO has two native tokens, NEO (NEO) and Neo Gas (GAS). NEO is used as a governance token, with a total of 100M to be minted. GAS is utilized as the fuel token, with a total of 100M to be minted, with a minimum unit 0.00000001. 10% of NEO tokens are used for NEO developers and members of the NEO council, 10% of tokens are used for developers in the ecosystem, 15% of tokens are used to cross-invest in NEO projects, 15% are used as contingency. GAS is created with each new block, with around 2M generated per year. NEO governance tokens are used to vote to choose consensus nodes, the nodes that create blocks and make decisions for the entire blockchain. The GAS per block rate is expected to initially be 8, then reduce by 1 GAS per year, until 1 GAS per block is reached. Once this point is reached, GAS will continue to generate at that rate for 22 years, until 100M GAS have been generated. GAS is utilized to to pay for transaction and service fees on the network. 

Neo features different technologies to enable its use. NEO utilizes a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus mechanism that utilizes large scale proxy voting. In addition, Neo features the NeoX protocol that enables cross-chain interoperability, enabling atomic asset exchanges as well as cross-chain distributed transactions.
