* Project Launch: February 20th, 2018

## Background
Petro is a cryptocurrency developed by the government of Venezuela backed by Venezuela’s primary natural resource - oil. Initially, Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan President, claimed that the currency would utilize the Ethereum blockchain platform; however, when the white paper was published it stated that the currency would instead be on the NEM platform. On February 20th 2018, Venezuela made 82.4M tokens valued at over $6B available for pre-sale. However, there have been questions about the legitimacy of Petro, namely that Petro is an attempt to circumvent US sanctions on international financing. On March 20th, 2018, President Trump issued an executive order prohibiting citizens of the United States from purchasing Petro. 

## Description
Petro is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to one barrel of Venezuela’s oil. Venezuela guarantees that it will accept the Petro as a form of national payment, using the basket price published on the official website of the Venezuelan Ministry from the previous day with a percentage discount as a price reference. The Petro to Bolivar rate is determined through an average weighted volume of authorized exchange houses. 

Petro is distributed at 38.4% for the presale, 44% for the initial offer, and 17.6% for the office responsible for the management of the cryptoasset. Of the funds generated from the initial offer, 55% will be used for a sovereign fund, 15% for the Petro project, 15% for ecosystem development, and 15% for technological development.
