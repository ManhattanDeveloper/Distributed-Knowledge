## Description
  Golem is a dApp built on the Ethereum network that allows individuals to rent out their unused GPU/CPU cycles to get paid in cryptocurrency, creating a market for computing power. Golem powers this global marketplace by utilizing a peer-to-peer network, with requestors (users utilizing resources) using resources of providers’ (users providing the computational power) machines. This system will also include an Ethereum-based transaction system so that payments can be processed between the parties. In addition, software developers can utilize the platform to improve the system and monetize their software. These developments can be published on the “Application Registry”, an Ethereum Smart contract. This system of applications relies on a decentralized network with users acting as authors (publishers), validators (reviewers who can manage blacklists of untrusted applications), and providers (selecting validators as well as maintain whitelists and blacklists). 

  Golem features a token called the Golem Network Token (GNT). Golem launched their ICO on November 12, 2016, raising $8.6M. The token can be utilized for payments to the providers in exchange for the usage of their computing power, as well as for payments for software developers. In the creation of GNT: 1,000,000,000 tokens total were available, with 820,000,000 going towards crowdfunding participants, 60,000,000 to the GOlem Team, and 120,000,000 going towards the Golem Factory GmbH. 

  On April 10th, 2018, the Golem team launched their Golem Brass Beta, the first beta for Golem on the mainnet. The project is currently focused on rendering 3D graphics utilizing Blender.
