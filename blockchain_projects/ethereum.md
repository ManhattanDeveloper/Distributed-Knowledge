## Description
Ethereum is an open-source public decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, enabling the building of dApps utilizing a custom blockchain that can be programmed upon. The platform enables any developer to utilize the Solidity turing-complete language to create distributed applications on the platform. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum relies upon a peer-to-peer network protocol that includes nodes responsible for maintaining and updating of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can be written onto this maintained blockchain; these contracts remain on the blockchain and self-execute. 

Ethereum features a native token denoted Ether (ETH). Ether is utilized for users to utilize the dApps built on the ethereum blockchain. In terms of issuance, 60M ether was created for the contributors of the presale, 12M were created for the development fund. In terms of future Ether creation, 5 ethers are created per block, and 2-3 ethers are occasionally sent to other miners that were able to find a solution, but whose blocks were not included. 

Ethereum has been utilized for the creation of dApps, protocols, and decentralized autonomous organizations. Examples include Golem, 0x, and DigixDAO.
