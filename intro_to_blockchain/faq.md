# Cryptocurrencies


### Is Bitcoin illegal?

### Who owns the Bitcoin company?

Bitcoin is not owned by any one individual or company. Although there are companies that support and use Bitcoin, it runs on a blockchain in a decentralized manner meaning that no one entity has full control over it.

### Why are cryptocurrencies so volatile?

Cryptocurrency volatility is a result of many different forces. In some cases, a currency is held by several whales who have outsized influence on the market. Lack of liquidity can affect prices if an entity wants to buy or sell large amounts. In other cases public opinion and media stories can affect the price as investor interest is affected.

### How can I buy a cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or through a broker like CoinBase. They can also be exchanged peer-to-peer if you know somebody who is willing to buy or sell. 


### Where do I store my cryptocurrencies?

Cryptocurrencies are stored in a wallet. Crypto wallets come in many different flavors. Some are fully managed by you while others are managed by third parties. Wallets can either be software or hardware products and can be connected to the internet or not. Each of these options and trade-offs provide varying degrees of security and convenience.

### How is using cryptocurrencies better than using Venmo?

Although cryptocurrencies allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a middle-man, in the developed world, middle-men such as Venmo are pretty efficient and inexpensive. The beauty of this technology can be realized in developing countries where the financial services industry isn’t well developed and digital money exchange is difficult and expensive.
