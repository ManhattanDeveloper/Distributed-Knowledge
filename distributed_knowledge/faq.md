### How can I trust the information on Distributed Knowledge?

Distributed Knowledge runs on the assumption of [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law), "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." With a healthy community of contributers and moderators, blatant erros will be avoided and those that slip by will be caught by members of the community and corrected shortly after.
